# MNIST Digit Classification with Keras

This repository contains a Python script that trains a neural network model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using Keras. The trained model achieves a high accuracy rate and can predict the digit labels for new images.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.10.9
- Keras (install via `pip install keras`)
- Matplotlib (install via `pip install matplotlib`)
- Numpy (install via `pip install numpy`)
- Scikit-learn (install via `pip install scikit-learn`)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/dineshghadge2002/mnist-digit-classification-ANN.git
   ```

2. Change directory to the project folder:

   ```shell
   cd mnist-digit-classification-ANN
   ```

3. Run the Python script:

   ```shell
   python mnist_classification.py
   ```

## Usage

The script `mnist_classification.py` does the following:

- Loads the MNIST dataset.
- Preprocesses the data.
- Defines and compiles a neural network model.
- Trains the model using a portion of the dataset.
- Evaluates the model's performance on the test set.
- Makes predictions on sample images from the test set and displays the results.

You can customize the model architecture, training parameters, and other aspects to experiment with different configurations.

## Results

After running the script, you will see the training and validation loss and accuracy graphs, as well as a visualization of some test images with their predicted labels.
